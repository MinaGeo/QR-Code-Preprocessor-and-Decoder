# QR code Preprocessor and Decoder

This project is a QR code preprocessor and decoder implemented in Python using computer vision techniques and the OpenCV library. The goal of the project is to preprocess the QR code image provided until it's able to be decoded by a decoder provided by Eng/ Ahmad Salama.

## Features
- Reads QR codes provided it
- Applies pre-processing techniques on the qr code to enhance image quality
- Generic pre-processing is applied to the test cases
- Decodes the pre-processed QR code and print the decoded string
- Decodes only Version 1 QR codes
- Can decode alphanumeric encoded QR Codes
